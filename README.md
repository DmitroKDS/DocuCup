# DocuCup

•	A one day hackathon project.

•	A web-based program that I built helps people understand complex legal documents. It uses AI(ChatGPT API) to turn difficult text into short, simple explanations that are easy for anyone to read.

•	I got third place in this competition


## `This program can be A little bit outdated`
